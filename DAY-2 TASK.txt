
Q1 : Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Answer : -
HTTP means HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL
HTTP 1.1  : wich is used to transfer the information between the client and server. using this HTTP1.1 we can send only one request at a time from browser to
server ,have to wait for response.can not send multiple request at a single TCP connection.its taking time so its slow process.

HTTP 2 : using this we send multiple request in single TCP connection from browser to server getting quick response and better performance.
from 2015 onwards all browsers support this method.in this connection its used SPDY method .
